# SE-ImageNet
Deenu summer research 2021 work - Preparing a large-scale repository of images for software-specific lexicons called 'SE-ImageNet' constructed on top of SE thesaurus ontology. Our effort on creation of SEImageNet database can provide the communities to excel in software engineering and offer unparalleled opportunities to researchers in the computer vision community and beyond.

This project aims to populate the 104376 classes or synonym sets for software-specific terms with an average of 500 high resolution images per term.
